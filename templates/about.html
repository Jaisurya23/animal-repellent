        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>
            This web application is a simple system built using the Flask framework.
            It contains two main sections: <b>User</b> and <b>Admin</b>. 
            Users can visit their login page and dashboard, while admins have a
            separate login panel and dashboard for managing the system.
        </p>

        <p>
            The purpose of this project is to provide a clear structure for how
            different roles inside a website can be separated using different routes.
            It also demonstrates how Flask renders HTML templates from the backend
            and helps beginners understand how to create multi-page web applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a basic version of the project, and more features such as database 
            connections, authentication, storing data, and user management can be added 
            later to make it a complete system.
